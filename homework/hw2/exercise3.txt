3. (iii) When the initial value is 1, the Sum progression looks almost identical to the geometric progression with 2 as its base. In fact, starting with any initial value, there is no need to actually sum all the previous values to generate the next value. Why? Explain.

When you sum all of the previous numbers in a series that begins with one, your next number will always be the previous number times 2. This is because if (1+1=2) and then you sum (1+1+2) to get the next number in the series, you will always be adding together the sum of the 'first sum' (1+1) and the result of the first sum (2). (2+2=4) results in the next number in the series which happens to be twice the previous number as expected.
